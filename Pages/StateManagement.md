# States

5 kinds of state:

* Model Data
  * The nouns in your application
    * The products your app is handling
    * Pokemons for a pokedeck app
* View/UI State
  * Sorting the nouns in alphabetical order or by date
  * Limit to 10 per page
  * filter them
* Session State
  * Is the user logged in
  * Are they allowed to see this
* Communication State
  * Are we in the process of fetching the nouns from the server
  * are we updating
  * is there an error
* Location
  * Where are we in the application
  * Which nouns are we looking at
  * If I send the link of a noun page, does the user land on that page or the HP

You can approach states based on their lifecycle
