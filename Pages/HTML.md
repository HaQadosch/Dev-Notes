# HTML 

  * Use semantic tags as much as possible:
    * it helps with accessibility
    * makes the css clearer
    * auto-documenting
    * browser features can be applied to specific tags
  
## rules and conventions

  * `H1` tag is for the title of the `page`, one `H1` only.
  * The header tags are based on the hierarchy of the elements. A H3 follows a H2, no skipping for the sake of font size.
